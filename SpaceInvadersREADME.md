# Welcome to the Space Invaders Clone repository!!! ðŸš€ðŸ‘¾

Get ready to defend Earth from waves of relentless alien invaders in this nostalgic remake of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders! 
In this project, Iâ€™ve recreated the iconic space shooter played in an arcarde, preserving the originalâ€™s intense gameplay and adding some exciting enhancements along the way.

This project is made as a project for my Grad Class. It is created using a custom 2d game engine by my professor. This repository will explain
how I have used more than 10 different code design patterns to create this game. I have coded this using C# language, using irrklang for sound integration.

## Features:
+ Classic Space Invaders gameplay
+ 2 Levels of alien waves
+ Increasing speeds with kills
+ Destructible shields and laser fire
+ High-score tracking to challenge your friends (or yourself)
+ Simple, clean UI
